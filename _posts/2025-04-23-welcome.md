title: "Hi, my name is ... and welcome to Bits 'n' Bytes by meansquaredlabs"

Hi, my name is Pascal. I love data and am fascinated by AI. In my current role as a Senior Solution Engineer and AI & ML expert at Snowflake I work with customers to generate value from their use cases and help them solve challenges with data and technology.

I decided to start this blog for two reasons: 1) Create an archive of experiences, best practices and deep dives to 2) learn and educate myself and others!

I also created meansquaredlabs, a place where I create and showcase my ideas, concepts and demos. I want to share those assets with my readers to support the learning process and make it more engaging.

Stay tuned!
