Hi, my name is Pascal. I love data and am fascinated by AI. As a Senior Solution Engineer and AI & ML expert I work with customers to generate value from their use cases and help them solve challenges with data and technology.

I decided to start this blog for two reasons: 1) Create an archive of experiences, best practices and deep dives to 2) learn and educate myself and others!

In addition to my blog, I've created meansquaredlabs â€” a platform where I showcase my work, including innovative ideas, concepts, and practical demos. By sharing these resources with you, I hope to contribute to your understanding of AI and data while keeping your learning journey engaging.

Stay tuned!
