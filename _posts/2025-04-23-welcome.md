Hi, my name is Pascal. I love data and am fascinated by AI. In my current role as a Senior Solution Engineer and AI & ML expert at Snowflake I work with customers to generate value from their use cases and help them solve challenges with data and technology.
I decided to start this blog for two reasons: 1) Create an archive of experiences, best practices and deep dives to 2) learn and educate myself and others!

Stay tuned!
